# Programming-a-Windows-Sandbox
Windows Sandbox provides a lightweight desktop environment to safely run applications in isolation. Software installed inside the Windows Sandbox environment remains "sandboxed" and runs separately from the host machine. A sandbox is temporary. When it's closed, all the software and files and the state are deleted.
